                This website is a gift, a special space for us to save our moments, our best pictures, the songs that mean something to us (like your favorite ones), and so much more.
                It means a lot to me to turn technology into something cute and meaningful for you, soâ€¦ I really hope you love it as much as I loved creating it for you. &lt;3

                <br /><br />

                I just want to say that I love you more than words can explain.
                You make every one of my days better.
                I love how you inspire me to be a better man every single day, always making me focus on our future so we can build an amazing life together.
                I cherish every moment we spend together, and I wanted to publicly show my love for you. &lt;3
